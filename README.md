# 👻 Snap Camera Server v3.2
An alternative self hosted solution for Snap Camera. It will let you continue to use Snapcamera with all Snapchat filters after the shutdown on January 25, 2023.

**This code is a fork of *jaku/SnapCameraPreservation* on steroids 💪** 
- ✔️ No previously backed up files or third party server required.
- ✔️ Access all Snap Lenses from **lens.snapchat.com** without restrictions.
- ✔️ Import Lenses from local application cache e.g. `AppData\Local\Snap\Snap Camera\cache\lenses`.
- ✔️ All files will be stored inside a Docker Volume (e.g. on your local machine).
- ✔️ Works 100% on Windows and Mac OS without missing Lenses.

You get the full decentralized control and you can use *Snap Camera* until Doomsday.

See the [📋 Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of changes and features.

## ⚠️ Pre-Requirements

- [🐋 Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [🔐 OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (Download from [slproweb.com](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) as Windows user)

*The client application is required to apply the filters to your webcam ([Download Snap Camera](https://github.com/ptrumpis/snap-camera-server/discussions/6))*
